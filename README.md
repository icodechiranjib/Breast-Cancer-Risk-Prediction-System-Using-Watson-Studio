## Project Idea:

###### Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide. Early diagnostics significantly increases the chances of correct treatment and survival, but this process is tedious and often leads to a disagreement between pathologists. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. But early detection and prevention can significantly reduce the chances of death. It is important to detect breast cancer as early as possible.

###### We will be building a model in Watson Studio and deploying the model in IBM Watson Machine Learning. To interact with the model we will be using Node-Red and scoring Endpoint.

## Solution Requirements:

###### Develop a model that is capable of detecting the Breast Cancer in early stages. The Machine learning model is trained and deployed on IBM Watson Studio and an endpoint is created. The web application is built using IBM Node-Red.
